# Changelog

<!-- Hi! -->

## tdl@8.0.2 (2024-12-20)

- Fixed a possible `TypeError: null is not an object` error in `client.login()`
  if called from a database with an incomplete login attempt.

## tdl-install-types@0.3.0 (2024-07-19)

- No longer generates `number | string` instead of `string` for `int64` types
  in output positions (the input int64 is still `number | string`).
- Better detection of `prebuilt-tdlib`: can now use TDLib commit and version
  from `prebuilt-tdlib/package.json` instead of always extracting the commit
  hash from the library file. The `--prebuilt-tdlib` option is replaced with the
  `prebuilt-tdlib` argument (`--prebuilt-tdlib` is deprecated).

## tdl@8.0.1 (2024-06-18)

- In bun (instead of Node.js), fixed updates/responses stop being received if
  none of those have been received in the last 10 (`receiveTimeout`) seconds.
- In bun, fixed the old tdjson interface exiting the process instantly.

This is related to bun < v1.1.14 only.

## tdl@8.0.0 (2024-05-28)

- The compatibility with `tdl-tdlib-addon` is removed. The `Client` constructor
  is no longer exported. The non-deprecated API mostly remains the same.
- TDLib < v1.8.0 is no longer supported.
- Node.js < v16.0.0 is no longer supported.
- The new tdjson interface is now used by default. The `useNewTdjsonInterface`
  option in `tdl.configure` is removed; `useOldTdjsonInterface` is added
  instead.
- Added `client.iterUpdates()` to receive updates via async iterators as an
  alternative to `client.on('update', ...)`. Example:
  ```javascript
  for await (const update of client.iterUpdates()) {
    if (update._ === 'updateOption' && update.name === 'my_id') {
      console.log(`My ID is ${update.value.value}!`)
      break
    }
  }
  ```
- `client.login()` can now accept the object directly besides a function
  returning the object.
- The TDLib errors are now wrapped in a new `TDLibError` class; `TdlError`
  is removed and replaced with `UnknownError`.
- Changed the default verbosity level from 2 to 1.
- Added `client.isClosed()`.
- Pre-built node addons now support aarch64 GNU/Linux.
- Removed deprecated client options: `receiveTimeout`, `useDefaultVerbosityLevel`,
  `disableAuth`, `useMutableRename`, `verbosityLevel`.
- Removed the `bare` client option. `tdl.createBareClient(): Client` is added
  instead.
- Removed deprecated client methods: `destroy`, `pause`, `resume`, `connect`,
  `connectAndLogin`, `getBackendName`, `setLogFatalErrorCallback`.
- Removed deprecated exports: `TDL`, `Tdl`.
- Removed deprecated events: `response`, `auth-needed`, `auth-not-needed`. The
  `destroy` event is renamed to `close`.
- `client.off` now returns `boolean` instead of `void`; the `once` parameter is
  removed. (The `eventemitter3` dependency is also dropped.)
- The old tdjson interface should work in multiple threads of
  `node:worker_threads` now.
- Now published with `--provenance`.
- Internal: The `tdl` client code was rewritten in TypeScript.

## tdl-install-types@0.2.0 (2024-05-28)

- Added a `--github-repo` CLI option.
- Added `-h` and `--version` aliases.
- The generator now indicates that the `bytes` parameters are base64.
- The version of `tdl-install-types` is now included in the header of the
  generated files.
- No longer generates `null` for return types of `Execute`.
- Functions not marked as synchronous are no longer generated in `Execute`.
- Added some special types: `$Function`, `$FunctionResultByName`,
  `$FunctionInputByName`, `$FunctionName`, `$SyncFunctionName`. `Invoke` and
  `Execute` are implemented in terms of these types and may be somewhat faster
  now (in typecheck time).

## tdl@7.4.1 (2024-02-16)

- Fixed a race condition (first reported when used in bun). This was publised as
  `tdl@7.4.1-beta.0` on 2023-11-07.

## tdl@7.4.0 (2023-10-10)

- Added `tdl.setLogMessageCallback` that allows to pass a callback to the
  `td_set_log_message_callback` TDLib function using Node-API's thread-safe
  functions. (TDLib v1.8.0+ only)
- `tdl.configure`: Added an experimental option `useNewTdjsonInterface` that
  enables the use of `td_create_client_id`/`td_send`/`td_receive`/`td_execute`
  interface with a client manager and global receive loop, though the old
  interface still works well. (TDLib v1.7.0+ only)
- Changed the implementation of the old tdjson interface bindings so that the
  limitation of max `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` clients is lifted.
- `tdl.configure`: Added a `receiveTimeout` advanced option.
- `tdl.createClient`: `receiveTimeout` in the client options is deprecated.
- `tdl.createClient`: Deprecated the `useMutableRename` advanced option.

## tdl-install-types@0.1.0 (2023-09-26)

Initial release of a new cli utility that is now recommended to use instead of
installing the `tdlib-types` package. It can generate a `tdlib-types.d.ts` file
when given a shared library / tdlib git ref / td_api.tl file and can be called
via `npx`. (See the "Types" section in the README for more information.) Changes
were also made to the generator to make the autocompletion faster.

## tdl@7.3.2 (2023-09-21)

- Fixed `Symbol not found: node_register_module_vâ€¦` errors on some platforms.
- Fixed passing falsy values to `tdl.configure`.

## tdl@7.3.1 (2023-06-22)

This update introduces some significant and long-planned changes to the
interface, while retaining backward compatiblity.

- No longer need to separately install `tdl` and `tdl-tdlib-addon`; just install
  `tdl`. `tdl-tdlib-addon` is deprecated. The library is mostly focused to
  Node.js only now, deno support can be added later as a separate library. This
  simplifies tdl.
- To better reflect the distinction between TDLib-global and instance-specific
  functions, TDLib-global options are now passed in the special `configure`
  function, and `execute` is decoupled from clients. As an example:
  ```javascript
  const tdl = require('tdl')
  tdl.configure({
    tdjson: 'libtdjson.dylib',
    libdir: '/usr/local/lib',
    verbosityLevel: 3 /* the default is 2 */
  })
  tdl.execute({ _: 'setLogStream', /* ... */ })
  const client = tdl.createClient({
    apiId: /* your api id */,
    apiHash: /* your api hash */
  })
  await client.login()
  ```
  The full documentation for the `configure` function is available in the
  TypeScript typings. The old `new Client` approach is still supported but
  deprecated.
- The `verbosityLevel` client option is deprecated (moved to `tdl.configure`).
- Added pre-built binaries for the node addon using `prebuildify` and `node-gyp-build`.
- Updated README to be somewhat more user-friendly. Aside of documentation
  changes, the library also should be simpler to use now.
- The packages `tdl-tdlib-wasm` and `tdl-shared` are deprecated. Any webassembly
  support is removed.
- Deprecated `Client#getBackendName`.

Old code:

```javascript
const { Client } = require('tdl')
const { TDLib } = require('tdl-tdlib-addon')
const client = new Client(new TDLib('path/to/libtdjson'), {
  apiId,
  apiHash,
  verbosityLevel: 0,
  // ...
})
```

New code:

```javascript
const tdl = require('tdl')
tdl.configure({ tdjson: 'path/to/libtdjson', verbosityLevel: 0 })
const client = tdl.createClient({
  apiId,
  apiHash,
  // ...
})
```

If the default values of `tdjson` and `verbosityLevel` are used, then calling
`configure` is optional.

## tdl-tdlib-addon@1.2.2 (2023-03-23)

- Fixed freeing unallocated memory on app shutdown if callbacks were set.
- Updated dependencies.

## tdl@7.2.0 (2022-10-11)

- It is no longer needed to call `client.connect` or `client.connectAndLogin`,
  these functions are deprecated.
- Added a `client.loginAsBot` function.
- Added documentation to the `.d.ts` declaration file.
- Deprecated `client.setLogFatalErrorCallback` and `client.destroy`.
- Deprecated the `useDefaultVerbosityLevel` advanced option, it is replaced
  with `verbosityLevel: 'default'`.
- Renamed the `disableAuth` advanced option to `bare`, `disableAuth` is now
  deprecated.

## tdl@7.1.0 (2022-09-18)

- Added support for TDLib >= v1.8.6.
- New functions in `LoginDetails`: `getEmailAddress`, `getEmailCode`,
  `confirmOnAnotherDevice`.
- Added a `client.getVersion(): string` function, undocumented in the README for
  now.

## tdl-tdlib-addon@1.2.1 (2022-09-01)

- On Linux, `dlopen` with `RTLD_DEEPBIND` (if available) is now used instead of
  `dlmopen`. `dlmopen` was not stable enough. This fixes some segmentation
  faults on GNU/Linux.

## tdl-tdlib-addon@1.2.0 (2022-08-29)

- Exports the `defaultLibraryFile` string. It can be imported using
`const { defaultLibraryFile } = require('tdl-tdlib-addon')`.
- On GNU/Linux with glibc, `dlmopen` is used instead of `dlopen` to prevent
OpenSSL compatibility issues.

## tdl-tdlib-addon@1.1.0 (2022-07-27)

- Fixes `Check failed: result.second` errors on Node.js v16+ (and sometimes v14).
This changes the representation of the `client`.
